                    <strong>Project Description:</strong><br>
                    Holiday gift giving can be stressful for many who are unfamiliar with the gift preferences of
                    friends and/or family. The ‘Holiday Wish List’ is an app that enables each participant to
                    add gifts to their list, and view or select gifts to give from the lists of other participants.<br>
                    The app will initially take the user to a <strong>Sign Up Form</strong> where they can join a group
                    of participants or proceed to a <strong>Login Form</strong> if they are already a member. After
                    successful entry, they can retrieve and add to their personal wish list, view the wish lists created
                    by other participants, and select wish list items to purchase from other participants. When an item
                    is selected from the list of another participant, the item is removed from that participant’s list.
                    However, the updated list showing the removal of the item is not visible to the creator of the
                    list.<br>
                    The app is created using Node and Express web server. The wish lists are created/modified using
                    MySQL database with a Sequelize ORM. The HTML layouts utilize Handlebars templates to display the
                    data which is added and retrieved using Express GET and POST route methods.

                    <strong>Project Description:</strong><br>
                    Business and leisure travel to many states or countries can be difficult if you are not equipped
                    with the proper attire, or knowledge of specific holidays in that area. The ability to view this
                    information before visiting the region can save the traveler time and effort through pre-planning.
                    The travel input criteria including: visiting city, start travel date, and end travel date will
                    initialize a server-side API from <a href="https://calendarific.com/">Calendarific</a>, providing
                    them with holiday information as well as useful facts about their destination. Information
                    pertaining to the destination country is supplied to the app by means of an API from
                    <a href="https://restcountries.eu/#rest-countries">Rest Countries</a>. The traveler can also
                    utilize the weather information for that destination, and select the proper clothing or make
                    appropriate plans to adjust for it. The input data is used to initiate another server-side API from
                    <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> to provide the weather information. The date
                    information is displayed using <a href="https://momentjs.com/">Moment.js</a>.

                    also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to
                    multiple screen sizes. When the user clicks a start button, a timer will start and the user is
                    presented with a question. When the question is answered, another question is presented. If the
                    question is answered incorrectly, additional time is subtracted from the timer. The game is over
                    when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0. The user can then save their initials and
                    quiz score.

                    events and/or tasks into assigned timeblocks. The current day is displayed at the top of the
                    calendar. Timeblocks in the form of rows are assigned for standard business hours (9AM to 5PM).
                    When viewing timeblocks for the current day, each block is color coded to indicate whether that
                    specific block is in the past, present, or future. When the user clicks on a timeblock, they are
                    able to enter an event or task associated with that time period. They can save the information by
                    pressing the corresponding save button for that timeblock. The information is then saved into
                    local storage.

                        the current and future weather for the last city that was searched. If there were no cities
                        searched, it will display the weather for New York, New York.

                        Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that is created using MySQL, Node, Express, and Handlebars.
                        It allows users to input the names of burgers they would like to eat. Whenever a user submits a
                        burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be
                        devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks
                        it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app stores every burger in a
                        database (burgers_db), whether devoured or not.
